NOTE: a big "THANK YOU" to all *Sponsors* and *Contributors* who helped to support docToolchain!

[TIP]
====
You like docToolchain?
What about helping to make it even better?
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project.
You don't have to code for doing so.
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).
